"""
Summary:

Input: Reads an integer n from the user.
Conditional Logic:
If n is odd: prints "Weird".
If n is even and between 2 and 5: prints "Not Weird".
If n is even and between 6 and 20: prints "Weird".
If n is even and greater than 20: prints "Not Weird".

Key Concepts:

input(): Gets user input.
int(): Converts input to an integer.
if, elif, else: Controls the flow based on conditions.
% (modulo): Checks if a number is even or odd.
Logical operators: Combine conditions for more complex checks.
